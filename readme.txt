== Description ==

This plugin allows sites to accept user-entered custom donation amounts through Paypal, including recurring donations.  This plugin was created in response to Paypal changing the functionality of their donate buttons in October 2016 and allows users access to features which Paypal made harder to customize/access.  This plugin features customizable options and text fields.

The front end view of the plugin is very basic.  I hope to add some more view options in the future.  For the time being, many users will want to style the plugin output using their own CSS.

I haven't built any tools to customize the look of the plugin yet.  You can disable the plugin CSS and write your own CSS.
